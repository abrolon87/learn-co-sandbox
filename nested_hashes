 #Here(above), we set a variable, instructors, equal to the return value of calling school[:instructors], which is simply the array of instructors.

Now, to operate on that collection of instructors, we can simply operate on our instructors array.

#to access data:
instructors[0]
#  => "Ian"

or

school[:instructors][0]
#  => "Ian"
