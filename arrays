# creating new arrays by constructors
# literal my_array = []
# class = my_array = Array.new

puppies = ["bulldog", "german shepherd", "collie"]

famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
maru_cat = famous_cats.pop
 

Calling .pop on an array will remove the last item from the end of the array. The .pop method will also supply the removed element as its return:
p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat"]
p maru_cat
#=> Maru

Calling .shift on an array will remove the first item from the front of the array. The .shift method will also supply the removed element as a return:
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
lil_bub = famous_cats.shift
 
p famous_cats
#=> ["grumpy cat", "Maru"]
p lil_bub
#=> lil' bub
