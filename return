def a_method(a, b)
  puts "hi"
  a + b     #we don't need to write return
end
 
a_method(1,2) #=> 3

#very common bug. Same problem I had in previous lab.
def a_method(a,b)
  puts "I got #{a}"
  puts "I got #{b}"
  sum = a + b
  puts "I got #{sum}"
end
 
a_method(2,3) #=> nil (because puts is always nil)
 
# Prints:
# I got 2
# I got 3
# I got 5

#to avoid bug:
def a_method(a,b)
  puts "I got #{a}"
  puts "I got #{b}"
  sum = a + b
  puts "I got #{sum}"
  sum     #don't puts 
end
 
a_method(2,3) #=> 5 (we just put the expression)
